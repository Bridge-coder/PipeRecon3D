"""Vision single-modal run on an InPipe-SLAM sequence: the OpenMVG + OpenMVS chain of the earlier project.

Same chain as run_pipeline.py (video input). Differences:
  - frames come from the PNGs written by ../extract_bag.py (RealSense colour camera), not from an mp4
  - intrinsics are the recorded camera_info of that camera (bag_info.json); RealSense reports zero
    distortion, so OpenMVG camera model 1 (pinhole) and no set_distortion step
  - program locations from scripts/paths.py; logs in LOGS/<work dir name>/

Usage: run_vision.py EXTRACT_DIR WORK_DIR [--every N] [--first IDX] [--last IDX] [--clahe] STEP [STEP ...]
       --every  keep one colour frame out of N in step 2 (default 5)
       --first/--last  colour frame index range to use (e.g. only while the robot is in the pipe)
       --part NAME --views FIRST LAST
                reconstruct one stretch on its own (when SfM cannot carry on across a jolt):
                step 7 only ranks initial pairs inside that range of view ids, and steps 8-13 write to
                sfm/recon_NAME and mvs_NAME. Steps 2-5 are shared by all parts.

Steps
   1 pre-flight: start each program once with -h
   2 prepare_frames.py: copy the selected colour frames (optionally CLAHE)
   3 openMVG_main_SfMInit_ImageListing (pinhole, recorded K)
   4 openMVG_main_ComputeFeatures
   5 openMVG_main_ComputeMatches   (pairs + matching + geometric filter; steps 5-6 of the original plan)
   7 pick_pair.py: rank candidate initial image pairs
   8 openMVG_main_IncrementalSfM, from the candidates of step 7 in turn until most frames are registered
   9 openMVG_main_ComputeSfM_DataColor
  10 clean_sfm.py (drop degenerate 3-D points), openMVG_main_openMVG2openMVS, then fix_mvs_k.py
     (principal point in the form OpenMVS 2.4.0 expects)
  11 DensifyPointCloud   12 ReconstructMesh   13 TextureMesh

Full output of every step is written to scripts/vision/logs/<name of WORK_DIR>/; only the tail is echoed.

OpenMVG 1.6 is used instead of 2.0: the 2.0 Windows binaries were built with AVX-512 and crash with an
illegal-instruction error on this CPU (Ryzen 5 5600, AVX2 only). The algorithms are the same; 1.6 simply
does pair selection, matching and geometric filtering in one program and names the SfM program differently.
